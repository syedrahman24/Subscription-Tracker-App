# 🔧 Fix for Data Reading Issue

## 🚨 Problem
- ✅ Data is being written to Firebase successfully
- ❌ Data is not being read when logging back in
- 🔍 This is a **security rules issue** for reading data

## 🔧 Solution: Update Security Rules

### Step 1: Go to Firebase Console
1. Visit [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `subscription-tracker-app-c4586`
3. Go to "Firestore Database" → "Rules"

### Step 2: Replace Rules with This Version
**Delete** all current rules and **paste** this:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /subscriptions/{document} {
      // Allow read if user is authenticated and owns the document
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      
      // Allow write if user is authenticated and owns the document
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      
      // Allow create if user is authenticated and sets their own userId
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Publish Rules
1. Click "Publish"
2. Wait for confirmation

## 🔍 Alternative: Test Mode Rules (If Above Doesn't Work)

If you're still having issues, temporarily use these test mode rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

**⚠️ WARNING: Only use test mode for development!**

## 🧪 Test the Fix

1. **Update the rules** (use the first version above)
2. **Refresh your app**
3. **Sign out and sign back in**
4. **Check browser console** for:
   - "Testing basic query successful"
   - "Fetched subscriptions: [...]"
5. **Your subscriptions should now persist!**

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

If it still doesn't work:

1. **Check the browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Verify the user ID** in the document matches your authenticated user ID
3. **Check if the `userId` field** in your documents matches your Firebase user ID

## 📊 Expected Console Output

When working correctly, you should see:
```
Testing basic query...
Basic query successful, found X total documents
Fetching subscriptions for user: [your-user-id]
Fetched subscriptions: [array of your subscriptions]
```

## 🚨 Common Issues

1. **User ID mismatch**: The `userId` in the document doesn't match your authenticated user ID
2. **Rules not published**: Make sure you clicked "Publish" after updating rules
3. **Wrong collection name**: Make sure documents are in the `subscriptions` collection

---

**🎯 After applying these rules, your subscriptions should persist between login sessions!**
